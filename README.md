# to-the-moon
A Python script for solving to-the-moon memento mini-games

## How to use
- Modify PUZZLE numpy ndarray (1 as correct piece, 0 as flipped piece)
- Run `python main.py` to execute **solver** or **inc_solver**

## Inc_solver
Rather than setting a specified move number, inc_solver will explore exhaustively from 1 up to a pre-set upper limit.
